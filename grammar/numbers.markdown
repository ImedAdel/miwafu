When spoken, numbers in Miwāfu are spelled out with a leading particle to indicate that it is a number.

Numbers
================================

Arabic | Syllable
-----: | :-------
0      | pa
1      | re
2      | chi
3      | ko
4      | mu
5      | za
6      | ge
7      | hi
8      | to
9      | fu

Numeral Particle
================================

The beginning of a number series is indicated by `we`.

	we parechi
	[numeral] 123
	123

The end of a numerical sequence is either a pause between words or `nwe`.

	we parechi nwe
	[numeral] 123 [end-numeral]
	123

Scales
================================

With large numbers, values are separated in groups of three. The separator is `do`.

	wa padorechiko
	wa pa do rechiko
	[numeral] 1 [thousands] 234
	1,234

If the entire group is zero, then the number itself can be skipped.

	wa padorechiko
	wa pa dodo rechiko
	[numeral] 1 [thousands] [thousands] 234
	1,000,234

Scales are based on the previous number, not the total magnitude. In English, one would say "1 billion, 1 thousand." In Miwāfu, one would say "1 thousand 1 thousand".

	wa padopado
	wa pa do pa do
	[number] 1 [thousands] 1 [thousands]
	1,000,001,000

In addition to using the thousands skip, there are additional amounts that can be interspersed with the number or used at the end.

Arabic            | Description | Syllable
----------------: | :-------
10                | Ten         | mya
100               | Hundred     | pyu
1,000             | Thousand    | do
1,000,000         | Million     | kya
1,000,000,000     | Billion     | jyo
1,000,000,000,000 | Trillion    | shyo

These can be combined together:

	pa doshyo
	1 [thousand] [trillion]
	1 quadrillion
	1,000,000,000,000,000

Decimals
================================

The decimal indicator is `rya`.

	paryapa
	pa rya pa
	1.1

Negatives
================================

If the leading `we` is suffixed by `-yo`, it indicates a negative number.

	weyo pa
	[numeral-negative] 1
	-1

Mathematics
================================

Simple math, addition and subtraction, is done with additional suffixes. `-yo` is used for subtracting values.

	we pa weyo re
	[numeral] 1 [numeral-negative] 2 [end-numeral]
	1 - 2
	-1

For addition, `-ko` is used.

	we pa weko re
	[numeral] 1 [numeral-positive] 2 [end-numeral]
	1 + 2
	3

In a series of math, only the final needs a `nwe` if one is required.

	we pa weyo re nwe
	[numeral] 1 [numeral-negative] 2 [end-numeral]
	1 - 2
	-1
